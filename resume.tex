\textbf{PROJECTS:}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Seed sowing bot:-} It is a microcontroller based automated device which is used to detect holes and then dropping the defined number of seeds in it accordingly. 
    \item \textbf{Transistor polarity checker(mini project):-} The aim of this project was to design a hardware which could be used to check transistor polarity that is whether it is npn or pnp type.
    \item \textbf{Home automation system:-} The aim of this project was to design a hardware using microcontrollers which could be used to control any electrical device [220 v , 4 amp]
    \item \textbf{A Pedometer circuit:-} A pedometer or distance counter is a device usually portable and electronic or electro mechnanical,that counts each step of a person takes by detecting the motion of the personâ€™s feet
    \item \textbf{Care taker bot:-} The aim of this project was to design a caretaker bot which fulfils patients requests, as
    directed by a host-pc which process images taken via a webcam over an arena resembling a hospital floor
    \item \textbf{PC Controlled two wheel balance bot:-} The aim of this project was to make a two wheel balance bot which can
    balance itself without any extra support and control its motion through PC
